# Real-world Developer Study: Survey Feedback 

## Response 10
- Q1. Experience: 3–5 years
- Q2. Heard of business logic vulnerabilities? Yes
- Q3. Previously dealt with them? Yes
- Q4. Current ways to discover/test business-logic defects:
  - Manual code review
  - External security review / Penetration testing
  - Static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube, Semgrep)
  - Other
- Q5. Is ~1 hour of annotations worthwhile? Maybe; it depends on the project's importance
- Q6. Biggest potential adoption barriers:
  - The time/effort required to learn and write annotations
